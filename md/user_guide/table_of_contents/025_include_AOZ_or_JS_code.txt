# INCLUDE CODE

## Include AOZ Code
Include allows inserting one or more AOZ source code file(s) into the current file. It is a very powerful instruction which allows you to create all kinds of procedures, routines, or data in external files. Therefore this helps make your main code more maintainable.

The syntax is:
**Include "Path to the source code to include".**

You simply indicate the path to the file to include. You can also, if the file is located somewhere in the AOZ Drive, just specify the name of the file. AOZ will perform a search in the AOZ Drive and use the file if it is found.

It is perfectly possible to have a file that is included in more than one other file. AOZ makes sure that no code is duplicated.

Here is an example of inclusion of code from the "AOZ Drive/includes" directory:
```basic
Include "fbdemo"	// Include the code for facebook...

Do	// The Program main loop
	...
Loop

// Call the code located in the fbdemo that is included now.
VIEW_INFOS  // is a procedure in the code included
```
<BR>

An other example:
Say this below little program file is saved as "AOZUtils/procedure.aoz"
```basic
Procedure TAG_DEMO
Print "This file will be included!"
End Proc
```
Then in another AOZ application, you can do:
```basic
#include "AOZUtils/procedure.aoz"
TAG_DEMO
End
```

<BR>

In the included files you can place labels that you can call from any code with the Goto or Gosub instructions. But be careful with the order in which you place your includes.

Advice: rather use the included files for the procedures of your programs, sorted by categories. For example: - user.aozinc - title.aozinc - menu.aozinc - game.aozinc

## Include JavaScript Code
Simply open brackets in your AOZ code { } with the JS code in it
For Example a code to print on printers: 
```basic
{
        var myText = "This text will be printed. Ceci sera imprimé";
        var myWindow = window.open(|;|;, |;|;, |;width=1500, height=1200|;);
        myWindow.document.write(|;<html><head><title>My Text tile to print. Mon titre de texte à imprimer</title></head><body>|;);
        myWindow.document.write(|;<p style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size:50px;">|;+ myText +|;</p>|;);
        myWindow.document.write(|;</body></html>|;);
        myWindow.document.close(); // necessary for IE >= 10
        myWindow.focus(); // necessary for IE >= 10
        myWindow.print();
        myWindow.close();
}
End
```
If you want to use a longer JS code you may like the following:

-You can use the instruction:  Load Asset "script.js", "my_js"
(You need to place the .js file in the "resources/assets" folder.)

-You also can use the : JS Execute "my_functionJS();"

Note that Load Asset does not support the HTTP link as CDN at this time (CDN...Content Delivery Network).
If you integrate the API JS files in your resources, your application will work, with and without connection.

**To load an HTML page from the AOZ code**

Example:
```basic
// in home.html
<h1>Bienvenue, %FIRSTNAME$%</h1>

//in main.aoz
Load "home.html", "home"
FIRSTNAME$ = "Bobby"
Show HTML "home"
%FIRSTNAME$% will be replaced by "Bobby"


//Other example to pass in the values of AOZ variables.
// Load Javascript
Load Asset "resources/assets/js/my_api.js", 1
// Load CSS for this application
Load Asset "resources/assets/www/css/global.css", "global"
// Load the HTML contents like for this application
Load Asset "resources/assets/www/home.html", "home"
FNAME$ = "Baptiste" : LNAME$ = "Bruno"
// Show the home page
Show HTML "home"
Do
  Refresh
Loop

// in home.html
<div id="fname">%FNAME$%</div>
<div id="lname">%LNAME$%</div>|;
```
The tags %xxxx% will be replaced by the variable value of the same name.

To modify the content of a DOM element (like innerHTML in JS ), here an example in AOZ :

HTML Element "fname", Content$ = "Bobby"

You can load HTML templates directly with Load Asset, and manipulate the HTML content with AOZ. Example:

Load Asset "home.html", "home"

Show HTML "home"

One of the advantages of this is that you can feed your HTML templates with the values of your AOZ variables.
