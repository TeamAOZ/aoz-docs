# MICE AND ACTORS
We have just seen that it is possible to control an Actor with the gamepad, keyboard or mouse, in order to move it around the screen.

We can also make our Actor sensitive to mouse actions (or on a touch screen it is seen by AOZ as the same, to be compatible). It will be able to react when we click on it (but gently, it might be sensitive), or when the mouse pointer passes over it.
