**Gosub** Calls a sub-routine at a specified label (or line number).  

## Description
**Gosub** is always used in conjunction with the **Return** instruction.  

When **Gosub** calls a subroutine identified by the specified **label**,  code execution is transferred to the position of the label, and continues with the instruction immediately following the label.  

When the **Return** instruction is reached, code execution will continue at the instruction immediately following the calling **Gosub** instruction.

## Syntax Options

**Gosub** label
**Gosub** lineNumber

## Parameters

|Parameter|Description|
|---|---|
| **label** | The label that identifies the sub-routine. |
| **lineNumber** | The lineNumber that identifies a sub-routine. |

## Examples
```basic
Gosub DrawCircles
Gosub Print2File
Gosub 100
End 

100 Print "Old fashioned line number."
Return 

DrawCircles:
	cx=Rnd(0 To Screen Width-1)
	cy=Rnd(0 To Screen Height-1)
	radius=Rnd(5 To 100)
	Ink Rnd(0 To 31)
	Circle cx,cy,radius
	Wait Vbl
Return

Print2File: Open Out 1,"myfile"
   Print #1,"This is..."
   Print #1,"...a test."
   Close 1
 Return
```

## Notes

**Label**
A label is a name used to identify a position in your program|;s code.  

- It consists of letters, numeric digits, and underscores.
- Spaces or other special symbols are not allowed in a label.  
- Both upper and lower case letters may be used, however, AOZ ignores the case used.
- Labels should not start with a digit.
- A colon : should immediately follow a label. 
- If code follows a label on the same line, it is recommended (but not required) that a space immediately follows the colon.

**Examples:**
MySubroutine:
Do_Stuff:
Time4Fun:
Fifty_Ways2Have_FUN:

**Line Number**
A line number is a special kind of label.  They have been included in AOZ to improve compatibility with older versions of BASIC such as AMOS.  Different rules apply than to regular labels:
- It must contain **only** numeric digits.  
- It is used at the beginning of a line of code
- It should **not** be followed by a colon like
- If code follows a line number on the same line, a space must immediately follow the line number.

**Examples:**
10 rem This is a remark
100 Print "this is a Print test"
12345
1234567890123456789012345678901234567890
(Unlike older versions of BASIC, line numbers in AOZ are not limited to numbers between 1 and 65535.  They can be as long as you like.)
