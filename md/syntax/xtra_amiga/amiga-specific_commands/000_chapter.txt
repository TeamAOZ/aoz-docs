# Amiga-specific commands

Note: in order to properly use the specific AMOS instructions and hardware compatibility of the AMIGA you should use the AMIGA manifest. A manifest is a configuration file that describes the overall behavior by default of your program, like screen size, instructions set, . 
You will find the Manifest in the ressources file of your program. 
It will be automatically generated when your create a new project and choose RETRO and AMIGA in the NEW panel.
In other words if you want to do an AMIGA AMOS program open an AMIGA and not an AOZ based program.

In particular the Amiga manifest add to lines in your source code. The following 2 lines must be kept If your program is intended to run also on a REAL Amiga:

Include "includes/libs/amiga/amiga.aozinc"
_CHECK_PLATFORM
