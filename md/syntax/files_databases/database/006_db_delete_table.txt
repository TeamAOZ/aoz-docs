Deletes a table from the current database.

## Description

`DB Delete Table Table$`

This instruction should be used for maintenance purpose only, to clean-up some tests you've done and purge tables you will not use anymore. \
The table will be definitively deleted, and all data will be loss, so you should be very careful when you use this! \
Please make sure you have selected the right database before calling this!

## Parameters

- `Table$`: The name of the table to be deleted. If empty or absent, the currently selected table will be deleted.

## Examples

```basic
// Without calling DB Database or DB Table, deletes the default table from the default database:
DB Delete Table

// If DB Database and/or DB Table is called before, deletes the currently selected table:
DB Database "my_database"
DB Table "my_table"
DB Delete Table

// You can delete another table than the currently selected table, but only if into the same currently selected database:
DB Delete Table "another_table"
```
