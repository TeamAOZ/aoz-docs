#displayWidth: 3840
#displayHeight: 2160

Screen Open 1,3840,2160,32,Lowres,lines=54 |; Open a screen in 4K resolution.
Palette 0,$FFFFFF,$FF0000
Cls 2
Pen 0 : Paper 2
Print "Screen 1"

Screen Open 2,800,600,32,Lowres,Lines=20 |; Open a screen #2 in 800 x 600 on top of the screen 1.
Screen Display 2,500,500
Palette 0,$FFFFFF,$00FF00
Cls 2
Pen 0 : Paper 2
Print "Screen 2"

Screen Open 3,800,800,32,Lowres,Lines=25 |; Open a screen #3 in 800 x 800 over screen 1 and 2.
Screen Display 3,1000,850
Palette 0,$FFFFFF,$0000FF
Cls 2
Pen 0 : Paper 2
