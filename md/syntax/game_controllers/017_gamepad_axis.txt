Function that returns the position of one of the axes of a gamepad or joystick controller as a positive or negative percentagle.

## Syntax

position# = **Gamepad Axis(** controller,axis **)**

## Parameters

| Parameter | Description |
|---|---|
| **controller** | The gamepad controller ID |
| **axis** | The axis ID on the controller |

## Example

```basic

```

## Description

How exactly the axes work is dependent on the web browser, and the specific controller used, however, ***most*** controllers and browsers follow this standard, with a few exceptions:**\***  

| Axis ID | Value | Action |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | -1.0 (-100%) | Move Left |
| 0 | +1.0 (+100%) | Move Right |
| 0 | 0 (0%) | No horizontal movement |
| 1 | -1.0 (-100%) | Move Up |
| 1 | +1.0 (+100%) | Move Down |
| 1 | 0 (0%) | No vertical movement |

On the primary joystick, Axis 0 is used for left and right, and axis 1 is used for up and down.

**\*** At the time of this writing, Firefox and Mozilla-based browsers such as Seamonkey incorrectly offset the axes by one, skipping axis 0.  AOZ compensates for this.

**Digital Controls vs. Analog**

**NOTE:**  AOZ|;s simplified movement functions are designed for digital controls.  This means that they return a boolean result (**true** or **false**... meaning **on** or **off**).  If the primary axes are analog (variable), AOZ will map these analog values to these digital functions.  As such, we need a sensitivity control, that will determine how much movement is required to trigger the digital functions.  This sensitivity is set using **Gamepad Threshold**.
