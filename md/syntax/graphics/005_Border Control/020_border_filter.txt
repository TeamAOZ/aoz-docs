Define and add a border filter

## Syntax

**Border Filter** *filterName$, value1, value2, value3, value4*

## Parameters

**filterName$**: Name of the filter to use (see list)
**value1**: First value to use, a percentage or a number of pixels, depending on the filter
**value2**: Second value to use, a number of pixels, only used on drop-shadow filter
**value3**: Third value to use, the blur value, only used on drop-shadow filter
**value4**: Fourth value to use, $RRGGBBAA or $RRGGBB color value, only used on drop-shadow filter

## Description

This instruction applies one of the filters listed below to any borders that are subsequently drawn around shapes or texts.

The name, so the effect of the filter is specified in the first parameter,  filterName$, and can be one of the following list, along with the first, second third and fourth parameter, which and type depend on the filter itself.

### Parameter Requirements

|**Filter**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|**Border Filter** *"blur", value1#*  | Applies a Gaussian blur to the border. The parameter defines the value of the standard deviation to the Gaussian function, i.e., how many pixels on the screen blend into each other, thus, a larger value will create more blur. A value of 0 leaves the input unchanged.|
|**Border Filter** *"brightness", value1* | Applies a linear multiplier to the border, making it appear brighter or darker.   A value under 100% darkens the image, while a value over 100% brightens it.  A value of 0% will create an image that is completely black, while a value of 100% leaves the input unchanged.|
|**Border Filter** *"contrast", value1* | Adjusts the contrast of the border. A value of 0% will create a drawing that is completely black. A value of 100% leaves the drawing unchanged.|
|**Border Filter** *"grayscale", value1* | Converts the border to grayscale. A value of 100% is completely grayscale. A value of 0% leaves the drawing unchanged.|
|**Border Filter** *"hue-rotate", value1* | Applies a hue rotation to the border. The value is expressed in degrees. 0 leaves the input unchanged.|
| **Border Filter** *"invert", value1* | Inverts the border. A value of 100% means complete inversion. A value of 0% leaves the drawing unchanged.|
|**Border Filter** *"opacity", value1*  | Applies transparency to the screen. A value of 0% means completely transparent.   A value of 100% leaves the drawing unchanged.
|**Border Filter** *"saturate", value* | Saturates the screen. A value of 0% means completely un-saturated. A value of 100% leaves the drawing unchanged.
|**Border Filter** *"sepia", value1* | Converts the border to sepia. A value of 100% means completely sepia. A value of 0% leaves the drawing unchanged.|
| **Border Filter** *"drop-shadow", value1, value2, value3, value4*  | Applies a drop shadow effect to the drawing. A drop shadow is effectively a blurred, offset version of the drawing|;s alpha mask drawn in a particular color, composited below the drawing.
 
Multiple filters can be used at the same time. For example, it is possible to display a blurred sepia version of a circle, with two Border Filter instructions before the actual drawing. Use Border Filter Del to remove one or all filters. 

Please note that like every complex graphical operation, Filters will slow down the display or the drawing,
specially complex filters like blur or drop-shadows. It is suggested to only use filters at key points, or
key graphics of your application and not everywhere.

## Example Code

This example draws three red circles with white borders, the first without any filters, the second with a blur filter applied, and the third with the blur filter and Border First turned on. Note that because the border is drawn first, the blurring of the border doesn|;t cover the third circle.

```basic
ink 6
border on
border ink 1 : colour 1,$5050a0
line width 40
Circle 600,540,300,1
Border Filter "drop-shadow",20,20,10,$ffffff60
border filter "invert",100
Circle 1320,540,300,1
```
