## Syntax
**Border First**

## Description

**Border First** forces AOZ to draw the border first on outlined shapes or bordered text. **Border First**  and **Border After** (on by default) can make a lot of difference when drawing shapes and text, and because the border is a line drawing, you have many options available to change how it looks, such as **Border Filter**, **Border Gradients**, **Line Width**, **Line Dash** etc.

## Example Code

In this example, three circles are drawn. The first has a plain 30 pixel wide border. The second one has a blur filter applied to the border, which allows you to see the edge of the circle which is covered by the border. The third circle has the border drawn first, so it covers the inner part of the blurred border.

```basic
Ink 2 : colour 2,$315f8e
Border Ink 1
Line Width 30
Border On
Filled Circle 300,540,250
Border filter "blur",20
Filled Circle 960,540,250
Border First
Filled Circle 1620,540,250
```
You will notice that when Border First is used, only half of the 30 pixel wide line is visible. This is because the line drawn is centred on the perimeter of the disc, so half of it extends beyond the radius of the disc, and half of it under the disc. Bear in mind that because of this, anything you draw, either text or shapes, will be bigger than defined if a line width of more that 1 is used. In this case, our Discs effectively have a radius of 265, not 250.
