<div class="compatibility"><span>Compatibility  </span><img src="https://doc.aoz.studio/assets/images/common/compatibility/aoz_logo.png" valign="center" alt="AOZ" title="AOZ" /></div>

## Syntax Options 
**Filled Squircle** *x1, y1* **to** *x2, y2, radius, corners*
**Filled Squircle** *x1, y1, width, height, radius, corners*

## Parameters



- **x1**: The horizontal coordinate of the top-left corner of the rectangle (before radius is applied)
- **y1**: The vertical coordinate of the top-left corner of the rectangle (before radius is applied)
- **x2**: The horizontal coordinate of the bottom-right corner of the rectangle (before radius is applied)
- **y2**: The vertical coordinate of the bottom-right corner of the rectangle (before radius is applied)
- **width**: The width of the shape in pixels
- **height**: The height of the shape in pixels
- **radius**: The radius of rounded corners.
- **corners**: A number between 0 and 15 controlling which corners will be rounded. If omitted, all four corners will be rounded.

## Description

Draws a filled rectangle with rounded corners using the current Ink, fill Pattern and Border settings (if applicable) on the current screen.

The **corners** parameter is a 4 bit number that defines which corners are to be rounded. It|;s easiest to understand representing it as a binary number like this: %1111, where each |;1|; is a rounded corner, starting at top left moving clockwise. For example %0011 would make the bottom right and bottom left corners rounded, %1010 would make the top left and bottom right corners rounded.

## Example Code

This example draws three different Squircles:
```basic
Ink 12
Line width 3
Filled Squircle 100,100 to 1900,400,20
Ink 6
Line Width  20
Filled Squircle 100,500,500,500,50,%1010
Ink 27
Line Width 10
Filled Squircle 650,500,1250,500,250
```
Here|;s another example using squircles to design  a display with tabs.
```basic

Filled Squircle 0,30 To 146,84,15,%1100
Filled Squircle 0,84 To 1496,800,15,%0011
Shade 60
For f=1 To 9
  Filled Squircle F*150,30 To F*150+146,80,15,%1100
Next f
```
