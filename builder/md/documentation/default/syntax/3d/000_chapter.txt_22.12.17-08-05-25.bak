# 3D instructions set
AOZ 222 offers a whole collection of instructions for manipulating 3D objects in your programs.
With the help of the 3D Scene Editor, you can build 3D sceneries for your programs and manipulate them very easily with your code.

<b>NOTE:</b> 
The 3D instructions for AOZ are still being implemented. The available instructions are still "experimental" and may change or disappear in future versions. But we are working hard so that you can have fun soon.
