Delete a database.

## Description

`DB Delete Database DB$, Share$`

This instruction should be used for maintenance purpose only, to clean-up some tests you've done and purge databases you will not use anymore.
The database is identified by its name and the sharing mode.
It will be definitively deleted, and all data will be loss, so you should be very careful when you use this!

## Parameters

- `DB$`: The name of the database to delete (will be unique into each sharing mode). If empty or absent, the currently selected database will be deleted.
- `Share$`: The database sharing mode.

## Examples

```basic
// Definitively deletes the current database, and all its associated data:
DB Delete Database

// Definitively deletes another database, which sharing mode is private for the user and application, and all its associated data:
DB Delete Database "my-database"

// Definitively deletes another database, shared with all users of the current application, and all its associated data:
DB Delete Database "application-database", "application"
```
