Bob and Sprites are the original instructions in AMOS (the grand father of AOZ) for the Amiga computer, they both now also works on the modern machines supported by AOZ.

***Unless you are an AMOS programmer we recommend to use the Actor instruction.***  Actor is the powerful graphic instruction in the AOZ language.
