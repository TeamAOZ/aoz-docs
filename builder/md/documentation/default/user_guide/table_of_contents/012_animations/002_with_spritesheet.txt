# WHAT IS A SPRITESHEET?

A sprite sheet is a large image containing a sequence of images that deceive the eye when they are displayed one after the other, to give the illusion of animated movement.

Here|;s an example:

The Actor instruction offers several parameters for using a sprite sheet:

- <b>Spritesheet$</b>: Is the name of the sprite sheet to use.

- <b>Anim$</b>: Is the name of the animation to play.

Check the Game example in this manuel: "Shoot-em-up game Kit" or in the folder Tutorials/2nd Game/shoot_em_up
