# THE DIRECT MODE
Up to now we have been using the Big screen and editing our code in the so-called EDIT MODE. AOZ Studio also has a Direct Mode, and this is the place to test anything as you go along.

To switch from Edit to Direct mode, click the Magician Hat button <img src="https://doc.aoz.studio/assets/images/en/image044.png" width="40px" valign="middle" /> from the top of the Menu of the Edit Mode, or on the AOZ viewer :

<BR>
You will then enter the Direct Mode.
You will still see your code output in the main window but now have two added features:
 The blue buttons and the direct mode console

<BR>
Let’s try. Type any program and RUN (F2) to view it in the AOZ Viewer (as you did earlier), then click on the magical hat to enter the Direct Mode from the AOZ Viewer.

You will see your program, great! And also the blue buttons, they are quite easy to understand, just try them out.

<table>
    <tr>
        <td width="55%">
        And below the AOZ "Console".
        Type your instruction in the console, like this:
        Print “hello”
        </td>
        <td width="">
			<img src="https://doc.aoz.studio/assets/images/en/image072.png"/>        
        </td>
    </tr>
</table>

What? Yes I believe the Blue buttons of the Direct Mode are self-explanatory, and if not you are very welcome to direct your concerns to our complaints department!
