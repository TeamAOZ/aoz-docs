# AOZ DEMOS

Now let's cut to the chase and have some instant fun!
Look near the top-left of your screen and click on the Demos or Games folder.

Open up a folder (locally or in the online AOZ Store) and click on the **main.aoz** (**main** or any other name).  Then see all the computer code that was written for that program. Many of them were written in just one morning between walking the dog and eating pizza. Please note: you do not necessarily have to eat pizza to program in AOZ.
