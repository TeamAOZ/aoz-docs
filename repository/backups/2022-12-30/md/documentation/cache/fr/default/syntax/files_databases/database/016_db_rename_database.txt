Gives a new name to the current database.
## Description

`DB Rename Database NewName$`

You may need to rename your database. All the stored data is kept.\
Be cautionous, as the renaming process can take quite a long time if your database contains a lot of data.\
The target name should not match an already existing database, or the renaming process may crash.

## Parameters

- `NewName$`: New name for the database.

## Example

First delete these testing databases if they exist, to reset data before testing. \
Let store data into a database, then rename it and read data from the renamed database:
```basic
DB Delete Database "test-base"
DB Delete Database "names-base"
DB Database "test-base"
Name$ = "Josua" : DB Write "Name$"
DB Rename Database "names-base"
DB Read "Name$" : Print "His name is", Name$
```
