# DRAG & DROP
Let's modify our procedure again:
```basic
Procedure CLICK [EVENT$, INDEX$, DRAGX, DRAGY]
  If EVENT$="dragdrop" Then Actor INDEX$, X=DRAGX, Y=DRAGY
End Proc
```
Here we test the type of action returned by EVENT$. If the action is "dragdrop", the user has placed their mouse over the Actor, held down a mouse button, and moved.

The coordinates of the displacement are contained in two other pieces of information: **DRAGX** and **DRAGY**.

Our procedure, for each call, then places our Actor at these new coordinates.

You can, for example, make a window and move it in a single instruction.
