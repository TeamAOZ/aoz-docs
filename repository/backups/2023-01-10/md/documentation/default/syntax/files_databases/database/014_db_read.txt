Reads some column values from the currently selected record and store them into matching variables.

## Description

`DB Read Columns$`

This is how you extract data from your database to use it into your program: copy column values to your variables and work with them!

## Parameters

- `Columns$`: The list of the `column=variable` names which values to read, separated by commas.

## Examples

This first piece of code writes the best score and player name into your database, if reached:
```basic
My_Player_Name$ = "Baptiste"
Score = 1000
DB Database "hall_of_fame", "application"
DB Read "Best_Score"
If Score > Best_Score
	Best_Player$ = My_Player_Name$
	Best_Score = Score
	DB Write "Best_Score,Best_Player$"
End If
```

This other piece of code (must be into the same application!) can get the best score and player name back, and show it:
```basic
DB Database "hall_of_fame", "application"
DB Read "Best_Score, Best_Player$"
Print "Best score, owned by", Best_Player$, ":", Best_Score
```
