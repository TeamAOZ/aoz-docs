## Description

The **Paint** instruction allows you to fill any section of your screen with a solid block of colour, fill image or gradient, depending on the screens current fill settings.

**Paint** works by tracing the outline of the area selected and creating a path which is then filled. If this path completely surrounds any areas of the screen which are a different colour, they will also be filled.

The optional mode setting can be set to either zero or one. A value of 0 ends your Paint operation at the first pixel encountered of the current border colour.  A mode of 1 stops the painting operation at any colour which is different from the existing ink colour. If there are any gaps in the boundaries of the sections you wish to fill, colour will leak out and paint the adjoining area.
