# MOUSE
Now let's see the final way to control an actor, using the mouse. This is the easiest control to define, because there is only one property for the instruction **Control$ = "****Mouse"**.

Try the following code:
```basic
Actor "magician", Control$="Mouse", image$="magic.png"
```
Our actor is positioned under the mouse pointer. And if you move the mouse on the screen, the actor moves with it. You can use this method to replace your mouse pointer with a custom image.

In some games, it may be necessary to move the actor only in the horizontal direction (like a Breakout racket) or in the vertical direction. No problem, AOZ has it all planned! Let's change the previous code a bit:
```basic
Actor "magician", Control$="Mouse: Honly=true", Image$="magic.png"
```
Run the program. The actor now follows the friendly mouse pointer on the vertical axis only. 

The Mouse has two properties: 
-	**Honly**:    True/False. Turns tracking the mouse's horizontal position only on or off.
-	**Vonly**:    True/False. Turns tracking the mouse's vertical position only on or off.
So in this example the vertical is False (by default the property is set as False).
This is interesting, for example, in a breakout game where the actor should only move left-right at the bottom of the screen.
