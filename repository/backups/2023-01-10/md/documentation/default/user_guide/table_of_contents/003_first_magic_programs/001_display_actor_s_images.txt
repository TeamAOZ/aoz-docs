# DISPLAY ACTOR|;S IMAGES

See an actor created by the Actor instruction as a graphic element that can be animated, controlled and give feedbacks.

Actor "magician", Image$="magic" 
works as is with no other parameters than it|;s name (here magician) and image (here magic.png). All the other parameters are set by AOZ by default. And we have many, many, many parameters to create magic... (See the "Going further with actor" and "Actor settings" Chapters)

You can use actors for example in a game for the character that the player controls, or for an element of the scenery, or enemies within the game. You can animate your actor by defining the sequence of images and much more.
In other words it|;s a visual element, essential for a game. 

For a professional application you can use Actor for the UI, to manage the graphic elements of the pages, check if the mouse went over or clicked on it, it is great to create Portals for example. (see also the UI Designer)
