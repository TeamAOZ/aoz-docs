Executes any SQL query accepted by the AOZ SQL engine.

## Description

`DB Sql Query$`

If the query returns results (e.g. `SELECT`, `SHOW`), you will be allowed to navigate through them using `DB First`, `DB Next`, `DB Last`, `DB Previous`, and `DB Pointer()`. 

## Parameters

- `Query$`: The query you want to execute, in pure SQL syntax.

## Examples

```basic
// Reset test data:
DB Delete Table

// Save two records of data:
Name$ = "Baptiste" : Score = 1000 : Data# = 5.28
DB Write New "Name$, Score, Data#'
Name$ = "George" : Score = 500 : Data# = 7.31
DB Write New "Name$, Score, Data#

// Search all data using pure-SQL (eq. DB Search All):
DB Query "SELECT Name$, Score, `Data#` FROM `default`"
While DB Pointer()
	DB Read "Name$, Score, Data#"
	Print Name$; " - "; Score; " - "; Data#
	DB Next
Wend
```

You may call any valuable SQL query:
```basic
DB Query "SHOW DATABASES"
While DB Pointer()
    DB Read "Database$"
    Print "-"; Database$
    DB Next
Wend
```

## Notes

Notice that writing pure-SQL queries may be complicated when you need to access `Variable#` float numbers or use double-quotes into your query. \
You should consider using `DB Search` calls and other function DB, simpler to write and read, when it is possible.

Default SQL engine and accepted syntax is MySQL 8.

There are several instructions for doing research that you can choose from depending on how difficult the design of the code is and how readable it is:

- `DB Search` and `DB Search All` are the easiest to write a search, and the most readable.
- `DB Search Sql` allows you to enter only the search criteria in SQL, it remains simpler than doing the SQL query entirely by hand. This statement introduces a little more SQL, and lowers the readability of the code.
- `DB Sql` is pure SQL, it allows you to do more than the other 2, we are full-SQL here, so itâ€™s even less easy to write and possibly to read.
