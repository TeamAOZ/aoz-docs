# AOZ Account instructions

AOZ program users may need an AOZ account to be identified and to secure they hosted data:

- When your program accesses AOZ account information,
- When your program connects to databases (see `DB` instructions).

`Account` instructions allow your program to control these accesses to the AOZ account login and registration process and data.
