# Database query commands

AOZ Studio allows you to store information in the form of structured databases, hosted on the AOZ Cloud or elsewhere.

- Without you having to install SQL on a server and manage your data structures: AOZ will do the work for you.
- Without you having to be an expert in databases or SQL language, 

As always you will find more info in the AOZ USER GUIDE with examples of code using databases DB instructions.

### Small glossary

To use these instructions wisely, understand the basic principles of database organization:

- A **field** works like a variable in AOZ: it is used to store data and is identified by its **name**. As with AOZ variables, a field name ending with $ is used to store characters, with # float numbers. Without these special characters, it will be an integer.
- A **record** is used to group several **fields**.
  The fields are stored in a record. For example a record made of the fields name, address, date of birth, telephone number.
  A record is identified by a single pointer, often called **id**.
- A **table** is used to store several **records** of  identical structure, i.e. grouping the same list of **fields**. A table is identified by its **name**. We can see a table as aâ€¦ table with one column per field, and one row per record, in which we will store values.
- A **database** allows you to organize several **tables** together. Related tables will be grouped together in the same database. Most often an application will need a single database where all the data concerning it will be stored.
