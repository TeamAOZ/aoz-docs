## Parameters



- **x1**: The horizontal coordinate of the top-left corner of the rectangle (before radius is applied)
- **y1**: The vertical coordinate of the top-left corner of the rectangle (before radius is applied)
- **x2**: The horizontal coordinate of the bottom-right corner of the rectangle (before radius is applied)
- **y2**: The vertical coordinate of the bottom-right corner of the rectangle (before radius is applied)
- **width**: The width of the shape in pixels
- **height**: The height of the shape in pixels
- **radius**: The radius of rounded corners.
- **corners**: A number between 0 and 15 controlling which corners will be rounded. If omitted, all four corners will be rounded.
---
Draws a filled rectangle with rounded corners using the current Ink, fill Pattern and Border settings (if applicable) on the current screen.

The **corners** parameter is a 4 bit number that defines which corners are to be rounded. It's easiest to understand representing it as a binary number like this: %1111, where each '1' is a rounded corner, starting at top left moving clockwise. For example %0011 would make the bottom right and bottom left corners rounded, %1010 would make the top left and bottom right corners rounded.
