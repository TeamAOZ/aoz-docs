Display a fully configurable shadow beneath any line or solid graphics drawn with any of the various line or filled drawing instructions

## Syntax Options

**Draw Shadow** _offsetX, offsetY, blur, rgba_
**Draw Shadow Off**

## Parameters


- _**offsetX**_: The distance in pixels that shadows will be offset horizontally. Positive values are to the right, and negative to the left.
- _**offsetY**_: The distance in pixels that shadows will be offset vertically. Positive values are down, and negative up from the image.
- _**blur**_: A non-negative number specifying the level of shadow blur, where 0 represents no blur and larger numbers represent increasingly more blur. This value doesn|;t correspond to a number of pixels,
- _**rgba**_:  A 32 bit RGBA value in hex format, like this $RRGGBBAA. All 8 digits of the hex value must be given, even if they are zero, for example $000455FF, otherwise the shadow will not be drawn. The |;AA|; part of the value represents the alpha, or transparency, level of the colour. Lower values produce a feint shadow whilst higher values produce a darker, strong shadow.

## Description
**Draw Shadow** allows you to add a shadow to any graphics drawn with AOZ|;s line or filled shape drawing instructions. With a bit of imagination, **Draw Shadow** can be used to create other effects, such as adding a glowing aura to an image.

Once the shadow is set, it will be used for all subsequent drawing operations until it is turned off, by using **Draw Shadow Off**.

Also, once set, individual elements of the shadow definition can be changed, such as the blur.
