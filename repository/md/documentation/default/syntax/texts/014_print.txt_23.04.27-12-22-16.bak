**Print** displays numeric or textual content in the current **Text Window** of the current screen.

## Description
In AOZ, the **Screen** is used to display graphical content.  This includes ***String*** expressions which are converted to graphical text using the **Text** instruction.  This text is displayed at a specific pixel position on the graphical screen using the coordinates provided by the **Text** instruction.  Only **String** results can be displayed with the **Text** instruction.  (Numbers may be displayed only if first converted to strings.)

Unlike **Text**, the **Print** instruction does ***not*** print directly to the screen.  Instead, it prints to a **Text Window** which is associated with the current graphical screen.  Every Screen opened in AOZ has its own unique text window.  The default text window for a screen is automatically created and initialized when the screen is opened.

The **Text Window** is used to display alphanumeric content in pre-defined columns and rows using special fonts with a fixed width and height.  (These are usually called "monospaced" or "fixed-width", and are the same kind of fonts used by the AOZ editor.)

Any number of string or numeric expressions may be printed in the **Text Window** using the **Print** instruction.  Expressions should be separated by  a semicolon **;** or a comma **,** .  

When expressions are separated by semicolons, the results of the following expression will be displayed immediately after the previous one.

### Example:
```basic
F$="A" : O$="2" : N$="Z"
Print F$;O$;N$
```
The result will be:
**A2Z**
...printed in the upper left corner of the text window.

When expressions are separated by commas, they will aligned in pre-defined columns (AKA tab stops).  By default, these tab stops are defined every 4 characters horizontally (column 0, 4, 8, 12, etc.).

### Example:
```basic
F$="A" : O$="2" : N$="Z"
Print F$,O$,N$
```
