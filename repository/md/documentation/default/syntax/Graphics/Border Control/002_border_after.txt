## Syntax
**Border After**

## Description

Draw the border after on outlined shapes or text. **Border First**  and **Border After** (on by default) can a lot of difference when drawing shapes and text, and because the border is a line drawing, you have many options available to change how it looks, such as **Border Filter**, **Border Gradients**, **Line Width**, **Line Dash** etc.

## Example Code

In this example, three discs are drawn. The first disc has a plain border drawn first, so the disc covers the inner half of the border. The second one has a blur filter applied to the border, and you will see the blurring stops at the edge of the disc. The third circle has **Border After** applied, so the border is drawn after, and you will see that the blurring now extends over the disc.
