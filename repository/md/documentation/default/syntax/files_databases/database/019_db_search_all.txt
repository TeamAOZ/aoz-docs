Search all records of the current table, without any filter.

## Description

`DB Search All`

When you store multiple records in a table, this allows you to get all of them. \
It is strongly discouraged to use DB Search All with a table which may store a lot of data : getting them all may be slow, and you may override your computer memory capacity.

## Example

You have an address book application filled with data (see `DB Write`): let's display them all:
```basic
DB Search All
While DB Pointer()
	DB Read "Name$, Phone_Number$, Email_Address$"
	Print "Name:", Name$
	Print "Phone number:", Phone_Number$
	Print "Email address:", Email_Address$
	DB Next
Wend
```

## Notes

There are several instructions for doing research that you can choose from depending on how difficult the design of the code is and how readable it is:

- `DB Search` and `DB Search All` are the easiest to write a search, and the most readable.
- `DB Search Sql` allows you to enter only the search criteria in SQL, it remains simpler than doing the SQL query entirely by hand. This statement introduces a little more SQL, and lowers the readability of the code.
- `DB Sql`  is pure SQL, it allows you to do more than the other 2, we are full-SQL here, so itâ€™s even less easy to write and possibly to read.
