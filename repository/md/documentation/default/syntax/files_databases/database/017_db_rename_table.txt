Gives a new name to the current table.

## Description

`DB Rename Table NewName$`

You may need to rename your table. All the stored data is kept.\
Be cautionous, as the renaming process can take quite a long time if your table contains a lot of data.\
The target name should not match an already existing table, or the renaming process may crash.

## Parameters

- `NewName$`: The new name for the table.

## Example

First delete this testing database if it exists, to reset data before testing. \
Let store data into the default table, then rename it and read data from the renamed table:
```basic
DB Delete Database "test-base"
DB Database "test-base"
Name$ = "Josua" : DB Write "Name$"
DB Rename Table "names-table"
DB Read "Name$" : Print "His name is", Name$
```
