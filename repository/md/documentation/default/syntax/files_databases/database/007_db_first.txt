Selects the first record among those found thanks to the last call to `DB Search` and its variants.

## Description

`DB First`

To be used with:
`DB Search` who may return multiple results. You can navigate through these results using `DB First`, `DB Next`, `DB Last`, `DB Previous`, and `DB Pointer()`.

## Example

```basic
// Write some data:
DB New
Name$ = "Francois"
DB Write "Name$"
DB New
Name$ = "Laurant"
DB Write "Name$"
// Read all data:
DB Search All
// You do not need to call DB First immediately after a DB Search : the selected record is always the first result:
While DB Pointer()
	DB Read "Name$"
	Print Name$
	DB Next
Wend
// Want to display the results twice : you will need DB First to start from the first record again:
DB First
While DB Pointer()
	DB Read "Name$"
	Print Name$
	DB Next
Wend
```
