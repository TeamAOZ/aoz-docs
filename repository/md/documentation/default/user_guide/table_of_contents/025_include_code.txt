# INCLUDE CODE

## Include AOZ Code
Include allows inserting one or more AOZ source code file(s) into the current file. It is a very powerful instruction which allows you to create all kinds of procedures, routines, or data in external files. Therefore this helps make your main code more maintainable.

The syntax is:
**Include "Path to the source code to include".**

You simply indicate the path to the file to include. You can also, if the file is located somewhere in the AOZ Drive, just specify the name of the file. AOZ will perform a search in the AOZ Drive and use the file if it is found.

It is perfectly possible to have a file that is included in more than one other file. AOZ makes sure that no code is duplicated.

Here is an example of inclusion of code from the "AOZ Drive/includes" directory:
```basic
Include "fbdemo"	// Include the code for facebook...

Do	// The Program main loop
	...
Loop

// Call the code located in the fbdemo that is included now.
VIEW_INFOS  // is a procedure in the code included
```
<BR>

An other example:
Say this below little program file is saved as "AOZUtils/procedure.aoz"
```basic
Procedure TAG_DEMO
Print "This file will be included!"
End Proc
```
Then in another AOZ application, you can do:
```basic
#include "AOZUtils/procedure.aoz"
TAG_DEMO
End
```

<BR>

In the included files you can place labels that you can call from any code with the Goto or Gosub instructions. But be careful with the order in which you place your includes.

Advice: rather use the included files for the procedures of your programs, sorted by categories. For example: - user.aozinc - title.aozinc - menu.aozinc - game.aozinc

## Include JavaScript Code
Simply open brackets in your AOZ code { } with the JS code in it
