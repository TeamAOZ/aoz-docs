# THANK YOU!

To our fantastic community of early users and beta testers. Nothing would have been possible without you during this almost three years journey in the making of AOZ Studio.

Please be patient with us. Understand that we are working on making a better AOZ Studio, which is still a long and winding road. But we really hope you will enjoy what we|;ve done together so far. And stay tuned for many more mind-boggling features.

Share all your ideas and requests on the Discord channel: [https://discord.com/invite/JmFyFRA](https://discord.com/invite/JmFyFRA)  in addition to benevolent magicians you will find us there to help you.

Discover the [AOZ Studio Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqqP2tA_D4fPVWQBi6DrXkg/featured)

â€¦Until the day when it is you who will help others; you will then officially have the status of Magician. But if you are already there it is because you now have the wand. **Well done!**
