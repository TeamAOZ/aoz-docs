# MOVE THE ACTOR WITH THE  MOUSE
We saw how simple it was to use the default keys or to assign keyboard keys to manipulate our actor on keyboard and Joystick. Now let|;s see how complicated it is with the Mouse.

As always with AOZ you can make it simple with the default settings and then progress by going into details.
The simple version of the move with the Mouse is:

```javascript showLineNumbers
Actor "magician", Image$="magic.png", Control$="Mouse"
wait // avoid the program to end
```

*Note: replace Mouse by Joystick or Keyboard to change the Control of the Actor.*

<BR>

Extra magic:
You can block the mouse movement in X or Y.
control\$="mouse:honly=True" will allow only horyzontal mouse movement
control\$="mouse:vonly=True" will allow only vertical mouse movement

*example:*
```javascript showLineNumbers
Actor "magician", Image$="magic.png", Control$="Mouse:honly=True"
Wait
```
