# DISPLAY ACTOR'S IMAGES
Can't wait to get images moving on the screen?

We understand you, and that's why we created the Actor instruction, so you can be the director in your Actor Studio, and direct your Actors.

There are several AOZ instructions for manipulating images, but the **Actor** instruction is the most powerful. It simplifies display, manages animations, it controls collisions and it will allow you to do magical things.

An actor is a graphic element that can be animated. For example, in a game it's the character that the player controls, an element of the scenery, or an enemies within the game. In other words it's a visual element, essential for a game as it is for a professional application.  

**Notes for more experienced programmers:**

				<li>
					As soon as you want to view or move an image, animated or not, you can use either the BOB instruction, which is AMOS-compatible, or the Actor statement we're talking about in this chapter.
				</li>
				<li>
					If you want to program in Object mode (OOP) the BOB statement is also OOP-compatible with settings similar to Actor.
					</li>
			</ul>
