# MOVING THE ACTOR
Now that we know how to display an actor, letâ€™s change our code to move it across the screen.

We're going to change our program and add a new parameter, called **EndX** like this:
```basic
1  Actor "magician", X=0, Y=0, Image$="magic.png", EndX=1980
```
<table>
	<tr>
		<td width="50%">
		Run the program by clicking on RUN (or hit the F2 function key), and your actor will move from left to right of the screen. 
		</td>
		<td>

		</td>
	</tr>
</table>

Note: to achieve the same thing in most other languages,  it can take a lot more lines of code, 20 to  100 lines. Each language has its characteristics, strengths and weaknesses, AOZ  has been designed  to offer powerful programming simplicity.

Let's break down our program. We've set the new **EndX**  parameter to 1980. **EndX** tells our actor that it must move from its current position to an end position defined by **EndX**. When this position is reached, the actor's movement stops.

Remember: you can put your parameters in any order you want, so you can also write:

```basic
1  Actor "magician", Image$="magic.png", X=0, EndX=1980, Y=0
```
To sum up: the starting point and end point of the movement is automatically taken care of by the **Actor** instruction, and it starts immediately. In this case moving from X=0, Y=0 until the X position is equal to the value defined by the **EndX** parameter, which is 1980.

We'll look at the **Duration** parameter that changes the speed of movement very soon.

**It's your move** ðŸ˜Š

- Stop the actor in the middle of the screen.
- Move the actor vertically using the same principle as the code above.
- Move the actor from the right of the screen to the left.  
- Move the actor diagonally.
- Use the image name **lucie.png**.
