# Animations
It's very nice to display images but it's almost certain that you'll want to animate them. In a game, heroes and enemies are rarely immobile, same for icons in an App. So let's see how to animate using two techniques: 
- with Animation instruction and 
- with a sprite sheet.

## Animation instruction

**Actor Animation** : Is an instruction to define an animation without a Spritesheet and to play it with Actor.
- Sequence$ is a string with each image name or number separated by a comma.
- The images can be located in the resources/image folder or loaded from elsewhere with the Load Asset instruction.
- The last value can be "L" to loop, "E" to end, "R" to reverse and loop.
- You can to set a delay in milli secs between 2 images like this: "1:1000, 2,..." to pause 1 sec. between image 1 and 2.

Example:
```basic
Actor Animation "gorun", Sequence$="1,2,3,4,L"
Actor "magic", Anim$="gorun"
```
The parameter AnimPlay=False will Stop (or True to Play Again) the animation is:

```basic
Actor "Magic", AnimPlay=False //or True by default
```
## What's a sprite sheet?

A sprite sheet is a large image containing a sequence of images that deceive the eye when they are displayed one after the other, to give the illusion of animated movement.

Here's an example:

The Actor instruction offers several parameters for using a sprite sheet:

- **Spritesheet$:** Is the name of the sprite sheet to use.

- **Anim$:** Is the name of the animation to play.

Check the Game example in this manuel: "Shoot-em-up game Kit" or in the folder Tutorials/2nd Game/shoot_em_up
