## THE LISTENER AND EVENT SYSTEM

Once the **Actor** Instruction is called, our actor can be "monitored" constantly by several **Listeners**. They check and scrutinize the activity of our actor and alert the program that a possible event has occurred.

An event can be:
- A collision
- A change of position  
- A change of image
- A key press

The name of a Listener always starts with **On...** and the parameter is a string containing the name of the AOZ procedure to call if the event occurs. For example in our previous program, when we defined the **OnCollision$** we asked the collision Listener to notify our program when a collision occurs and to call the procedure while giving it some information (or properties). In this case it was the name of the actor that was hit.

Note that your AOZ procedure can exploit a few of these properties, you don't have to set them all.

We have several Listeners each with a set of properties (to be written in capital) for the Actor instruction, we will see this in the next chapter.
