# The various possible controls

**Note: this Instruction and chapter is Work In Progress**

We saw that it was quite easy to control an actor with the **Control$** parameter. It is possible to assign multiple controls to an actor (e.g., keyboard and joystick).

As a reminder, a control is always defined as:
&lt;name of the control&gt; : property1 = value1 ; property2 = value2...

The  properties must be separated by a semicolon ( ; )

Here is a description of the different types of controls available with the Actor instruction.
