# Group$ Actors
Even better, we can associate several Actors in a group (for example the “monster” group) and test an Actor and a group:
```basic
1  Actor "monster1",  Image$ = "monster1.png", Group$ = « monster »
2  Actor "monster2",  Image$ = "monster2.png", Group$ = « monster »
3  If Actor Col ("magic", Group$= "monster" ) = True Then ... 
```
See the MagicBird tutorial (mini game) as an example. There is also a video tutorial of it on the AOZ Studio YouTube channel.

With AOZ, the collisions work to the nearest pixel ("pixel perfect") and not when the boxes surrounding the actors touch each other, so it's much more precise.
