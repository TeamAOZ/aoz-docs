# LOOKAT$
We are going to talk about about Hotspots and a fun new instruction: **LookAt$**

Here's a brand new program so you can see what **LookAt$** does for a living.
```javascript showLineNumbers
1 Actor "ship", X=Screen Width/2, Y=Screen Height/2, Image$="ship.png", LookAt$="Mouse"
```
Run the program: Our actor is displayed on the screen as you would expect. Now move your mouse, and notice how your actor seems to look in its direction!

Let's break down our program:  
- _Line 1_: We display the actor at the center of the screen which is the Width and Height divided by 2. The **LookAt$**  parameter has the property  "Mouse". You need to understand that this tells the actor to orient itself in such a way as to always face the tip of the mouse.<br />
**Screen Width** and **Screen Height** are two functions that returns the size of the screen in pixels. By default it is 1920x 1080 (full HD, 2M. pixels) but you can change the resolution of the screen.

			But, but... your actor is not at all centered, and it looks like it's circling around something. Weird			
	</td>
	</tr>
