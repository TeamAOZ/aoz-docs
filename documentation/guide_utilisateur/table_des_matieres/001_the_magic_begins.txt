# THE MAGIC BEGINS
Hello!

Glad to welcome you to the magical world of AOZ Studio.

If you know nothing about programming but want to publish the app, game, or website of your dreams, you have come to the right place. If you are already a pro and want to develop much faster, you have come to the right place.

If you want to start programming right away, you have come to the right place, otherwise you can start by reading: _AOZ Studio -Introduction.

### INSTALLING AOZ STUDIO
Very good news! Only one installation of the “AOZ Studio” app on your PC or MAC is required. Everything is included, and once the installation is completed you are up and running to start programming. I can confirm you don't have to read 20 pages on how to Install, configure editor, compiler, libraries, SDK, API...

To get the latest version of AOZ Studio, guess where? [www.aoz.studio](www.aoz.studio)

### YOUR FIRST PROGRAM
Please launch AOZ Studio on your PC or MAC:
![enter image description here](https://doc.aoz.studio/assets/images/image008.png)

1 ) Look in the large black, empty window on your AOZ Studio screen and type in your first line of code:
```javascript showLineNumbers
1 Print "Hello World"
```
Like this:
![enter image description here](https://doc.aoz.studio/assets/images/image009.png)

2 ) Discover at the top the most important buttons.

Like <b>RUN</b> that's the one with the play icon.

3 ) Click the RUN button (or hit F2 key) <img valign="middle" width="56px" src="https://doc.aoz.studio/assets/images/image046.png" /> 

Wait a few seconds, and now you can see printed “**Hello World**”.
Congratulations! You are now a computer programmer!

If you think that's magic, you're absolutely right. You just gave your computer a simple instruction to print something on the screen, and to do that you used **Print**, which is an instruction your computer understands in the AOZ language that you have begun to learn.

OK, let's move on.

Type in these lines of code, using the Return key to create each new line:
```javascript
1 Print "Hello World"
2 Wait Key
3 Boom
4 Print "goodbye"
```
You'll notice that AOZ tries to help you every step of the way by offering help and hints as you type, and it will even display different elements of your computer code in their own colors. For example, instructions are shown in blue.

Do you have any questions about your new program?
 - The instruction **Wait Key**, simply tells the computer or smartphone to wait until a key is pressed.
 - The instruction **Boom**, guess what…?

So this program will print “Hello World”, wait for a key press, then play the boom sound and politely say goodbye. We like to keep your machines polite.

Here comes the magic again: Click on one of the **RUN buttons**. Yes actually we have two of them at the top of the AOZ Studio screen, they look like this:
<p align="center"><img valign="middle" width="56px" src="https://doc.aoz.studio/assets/images/image045.png" />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img valign="middle" width="56px" src="https://doc.aoz.studio/assets/images/image046.png" /> 
 </p>


There are two of them, because your program may run on:

 - a Web Browser <img valign="middle" width="32px" src="https://doc.aoz.studio/assets/images/image045.png" /> (like Chrome, Edge)
 
 or

- in the AOZ viewer <img valign="middle" width="32px" src="https://doc.aoz.studio/assets/images/image046.png" />  (inside AOZ Studio)

Once again wait a few seconds and your program will run automatically.

Now you know the main principles. We are going to have much more fun, but first, let’s see some quick boring stuff.
