# THE EDIT MODE
Finding your way around AOZ Studio has been made as simple as possible with everything on one Edit Screen.

- The project folders are on the left
- The main big working screen area is on the right, and
- The Menu icons are at the top

Since the beginning of this User Guide we have been using this EDIT MODE and you are probably wondering what you can do with all these buttons.
