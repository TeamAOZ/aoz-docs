# AUTO$
Let's go further and change your code like this:
```javascript showLineNumbers
Actor "ship", X=Screen Width/2, Y=Screen Height/2, Image$="ship.png", LookAt$="Mouse", Hotspot$=****"****middle****"****, Auto$="forward=4"
```

Run the program. Your actor continues to look at the tip of your mouse, but this time it's chasing it, so watch out!

**Auto$**: is another great parameter of Actor, it gives the instructions to do automatically what is indicated by itâ€™s property, here **forward=4** will move automatically (towards the mouse pointer).
