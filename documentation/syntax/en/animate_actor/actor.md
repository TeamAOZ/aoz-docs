Actor is one of the powerful graphical commands offered by the AOZ language. Actor allows:

* display sprites and scenery on the screen     But not only. Soon, you will also be able to manipulate your 3D objects, your robots, with the same ease.
* to manipulate the graphic elements of the screen with the mouse, the keyboard or the gamepad
* animate your characters very easily&#x20;
* apply a behavior to a played or unplayed character, like jumping or flying.
* associate events, such as the "click" of the mouse, with images
* move your images on the screen.&#x20;
* apply effects, like rotation, resizing...

But not only. Soon, you will also be able to manipulate your 3D objects, your robots, with the same ease.
