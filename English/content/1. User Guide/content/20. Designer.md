3. Click on the SETTING button of the DESIGNER MENU:
In the Settings section you may create different pages and choose the resolution, background color, default font etc.

4. Then back in the First button: Components, start creating your page(s) design with different components.
Note: some specific parameters at the bottom of the Properties page: "**OnClick"** or "**OnChange**", here you can set the name of the procedure that will be called in your AOZ program once the event occurs. 
Example: A CheckBox is checked:

5. Finally hit the **Update Code Editor Button** (Green button)
This will automatically generate the corresponding AOZ code in your program source window. Then you can transpile with the RUN buttons.

Note: you can modify the DESIGNER code in your program and later go back in the DESIGNER. It will recognize its code allowing to modify anytime from DESIGNER and from the AOZ editor.

Here is a useful link that presents all the CSS classes of Bootstrap (usable with the UI Designer): [https://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap/bootstrap_ref_all_classes.asp](https://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap/bootstrap_ref_all_classes.asp)
