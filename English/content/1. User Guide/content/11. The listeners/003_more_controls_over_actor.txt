# More Controls over Actor

### Actor Reset
Reset all the actor properties. Example:
```basic
Actor Reset 1
Actor Reset "magic"
Actor Reset  // Remove All the actors**
```
### Actor Del
Delete one or all the actors, or an actor specifically with its name (so it will not be displayed). Examples:
Actor Del "name"
Actor Del "*"
```basic
Cls 0
Actor "forest", image$="bg"
Actor "Magic", X=100, Y=50, image$="magic"
Wait 2
Actor Del "Magic"  	// delete only the Magic actor
Actor Del "*" 		// delete all actors
```

### Visible Parameter

To show or hide the actor (Visible=True or False)
```basic
Actor "magic", X=100, Y=100, Image$="magic.png"
Wait Key : Actor "magic", Visible=False
Wait Key : Actor "magic", Visible=True
```

### Enable Parameter

If Enable=False, even if the Actor has Control$ and animations, the image stays displayed but all behaviors are frozen. Very useful to do a clickable button that you want to enable or disable on your user interface.
```basic
Actor "magic", X=100, Y=100, Image$="magic.png", Control$="keyboard", Enable=False
Do
  Refresh
Loop
```


```basic
Actor 1, Image$="bg.png", Y=0, Control$="ArrowLeft: offsetX=5; ArrowRight: offsetX=-5", OnChange$="ON_CHANGE"**
Do
  Refresh
Loop

Procedure ON_CHANGE [INDEX$,X]
If X > 0 Then Actor INDEX$, X = -1980
If X < -1980 Then Actor INDEX$, X = 0
End Proc
```
You see in the above example that the listener is calling the procedure "ON_CHANGE" each time the actor undergoes a change in position (due to a Key press) passing along the properties automatically, here **INDEX$** and **X**

So when actor 1 moves on the screen the procedure is called with the actor name in INDEX$ and its X position, as properties. The code in the procedure may use these properties to check if we reached the limit of 1980 pixels (remember it is half the size of the graphics) and to restart if we did.
