Writes the values of the listed columns from the program variables to the currently selected record of the current table.

## Description

`DB Write Column$`

This is how you write data into your database, to be able to get them back or to share it with other users. Copy your variable values into your records and write them!

## Parameters

- `Columns$`: The list of the `column=variable` names which values to write, separated by commas.

## Examples

This first piece of code writes the best score and player name into your database, if reached:
```basic
My_Player_Name$ = "Baptiste"
Score = 1000
DB Database "hall_of_fame", "application"
DB Read "Best_Score"
If Score > Best_Score
	Best_Player$ = My_Player_Name$
	Best_Score = Score
	DB Write "Best_Score, Best_Player$"
End If
```

This other piece of code (must be into the same application !) can get the best score and player name back, and show it:
```basic
DB Database "hall_of_fame", "application"
DB Read "Best_Score,Best_Player$"
Print "Best score, owned by", Best_Player$, ":", Best_Score
```

This example fills in an address book that you will be able to read thanks to the examples for the `DB Search` instructions:
```basic
DB New
Name$ = "Baptiste"
Phone_Number$ = "+33555789"
Email_Address$ = "baptiste@email.aoz"
City$ = "Rennes"
DB Write "Name$, Phone_Number$, Email_Address$, City$"
DB New
Name$ = "Laurant"
Phone_Number$ = "+33555123"
Email_Address$ = "laurant@email.aoz"
City$ = "Paris"
DB Write "Name$, Phone_Number$, Email_Address$, City$"
```

In the example above, you may consider using `DB Write New` instead of both `DB New` and `DB Write`: both on one instruction.
