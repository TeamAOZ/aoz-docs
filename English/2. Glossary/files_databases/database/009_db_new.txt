Selects a new record.

## Description

`DB New`

You have to use this to store multiple records into your table: this selects a new record, without pointer, ready to write new data.

## Example

Two records will be written into your database, one for "Francois", the other one for "Laurant":
```basic
DB New
Name$ = "Francois"
DB Write "Name$"
DB New
Name$ = "Laurant"
DB Write "Name$"
```
