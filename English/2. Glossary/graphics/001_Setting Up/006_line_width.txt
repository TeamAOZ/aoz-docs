Set the line width to be used in all line drawings

## Syntax
**Line Width** *width*


## Parameters

_**width**_: The width or thickness of the line in pixels

## Description

This instruction sets the width of all lines that are subsequently drawn, including borders. The **Line Width** can be set to any value above 0. The following example draws circles using a line widths from 1 to 10 pixels wide.

If the **Border First** instruction is used, it is important to note that the visible line width will be half of the **Line Width** value.

## Example Code

```basic
Ink 1
For f=1 to 10
	Line Width f
	Circle f*150,540,60
Next f
```

The line width can also be set to less than 1. The next example shows what the circles will look like with line widths from 0.1 to 1.0.
 You will see that for very thin lines, they appear much fainter.

```basic
Ink 1
For f=1 to 10
	Line Width f/10
	Circle f*150,540,60
Next f
```
