## Description

**Bobs** are a special type of graphic objects that belong to a specific screen. They can be manipulated in many ways: moved, scaled, skewed, rotated, clipped, hidden and more. When a **Bob** is defined, it will be created on the current active screen, and remain a part of that screen until it is closed using **Screen Close** or the **Bob** is destroyed using **Bob Off**.

Each screen has it|;s own bobs, so the same bob numbers or names can be used on different screens.

**Bob** *index*
- Defines **Bob** with number or name _**index**_ and default settings. Nothing will be displayed on the screen until and image is assigned to it.

**Bob** *index, x, y*
- Defines **Bob** with number or name _**index**_ with coordinates _**x, y**_ and other default settings. Nothing will be displayed on the screen until an image is assigned to it.

**Bob** *index, x, y, image*
- Defines **Bob** with number or name _**index**_ with coordinates _**x, y**_, image _**image**_ and other default settings. The **Bob** will be displayed on the screen at the next update in a non-destructive way.
