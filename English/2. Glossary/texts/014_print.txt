**Print** displays numeric or textual content in the current **Text Window** of the current screen.

## Background
In AOZ, the **Screen** is used to display graphical content.  This includes ***String*** expressions which are converted to graphical text using the **Text** instruction.  This text is displayed at a specific pixel position on the graphical screen using the coordinates provided by the **Text** instruction.  Only ***String*** results can be displayed with the **Text** instruction.  (***Numeric*** expressions ***may*** be used oly if they|;re converted to strings.)

Unlike **Text**, the **Print** instruction does ***not*** print directly to the graphical screen.  Instead, it prints to a **Text Window** which is associated with the current graphical screen.  Every Screen opened in AOZ has its own unique text window.  The default text window for a screen is automatically created and initialized when the screen is opened.

The **Text Window** is used to display alphanumeric content in pre-defined columns and rows using special fonts with a fixed width and height.  (These are usually called "monospaced" or "fixed-width", and are the same kind of fonts used by the AOZ editor.)  

## Description:

The **Print** instruction displays strings or numbers on the **Text Window** associated with the current screen.  Any number of string or numeric expressions may be printed in the **Text Window** using the **Print** instruction.  Expressions should be separated by  a semicolon **;** or a comma **,** .  

When expressions are separated by semicolons, the results are printed on the same line with no space between them.

### Semicolon Example:
```basic
A$="A" : O$="O" : Z$="Z"
Print "01234567890"
Print A$;O$;Z$
```
Result:
<pre>01234567890
AOZ</pre>
...printed in the upper left corner of the text window.

When expressions are separated by commas, they will aligned in pre-defined columns (AKA tab stops).  By default, these tab stops are defined every 4 characters horizontally (column 0, 4, 8, 12, etc.).

### Comma Example:
```basic
A$="A" : O$="O" : Z$="Z"
Print "01234567890"
Print A$,O$,Z$
```
Result:
<pre>01234567890
A   O   Z</pre>

If a semicolon or comma is used at the end of a line, it will work similarly, but will affect the *next* **Print** instruction.  For the semicolon, it will leave the text cursor at the next character on the same line.  For the comma, it will leave the text cursor at the next tab stop.  For example:

```basic
A$="A" : O$="O" : Z$="Z"
Print "0123456789012 semicolons"
Print A$;B$;C$;
Print " is fun!"
Print "0123456789012 commas"
Print A$,B$,C$,
Print " is fun!"
```
Result:
<pre>0123456789012 semicolons
AOZ is fun!
0123456789012 commas
A   O   Z   is fun!</pre>
