## Description

`DB Database DB$, Share$`

This instruction allows you to work with multiple databases. \
You can also work with shared databases, common for a user, for all users of an application, etc. \
Each database is identified by its name and a sharing mode. They are stored on the cloud, but will be always accessible to an author applications only, and shared between your users and applications following strict restrictions you set choosing the right sharing mode.

If you do not use `DB Database` calls, a default database named "default" which will only be usable by the final user, and only into this application, will be used when you call DB instructions.

To enable database sharing, or to work on access multiple databases into your application, call `DB Database`!

The available sharing modes are:

- `author`: this database is common to all applications developed by the software author, and common to all users. You may store here general information you want to be updated once for all your apps, like news about the author, hall of fame of the best players of all your games, or a common country codes table for all your management softwares, that you will manage at one place, etc.
- `application`: this database is common to all users that will use the application. You may use this sharing mode to store eg a best scores panel for a game
- `user-author`: this private database is common to all applications developed by the software author, but will be different for each user of your softwares
- `user-application`: this database is private for the user, and limited to the current application. This is the most private storage, and the sharing mode used by default when you don't precise another one

## Parameters

- `DB$`: The name of the database will be unique into each sharing mode
- `Share$`: The database sharing mode

## Examples

```basic
// Read the player personal record for this game (private and will not be visible by any other player ever):
DB Database "scores"
