The easiest way to search records into the current table by matching a simple search expression.

## Description

`DB Search Search$`

Search records into the current table that match the simplified search expression. \
When you store multiple records in a table, this allows you to search some of them.

## Parameters

- `Search$`: The search expression, like: `Column1$=Value, Column2=101`.

## Example

You have an address book application filled with data (see `DB Write`) : let's find someone's coordinates, knowing its name and city:
```basic
DB Search "Name$=Baptiste, City$=Rennes"
DB Read "Name$, Phone_Number$, Email_Address$"
Print "Name:", Name$
Print "Phone number:", Phone_Number$
Print "Email address:", Email_Address$
```

## Notes

There are several instructions for doing research that you can choose from depending on how difficult the design of the code is and how readable it is:

- `DB Search` and `DB Search All` are the easiest to write a search, and the most readable.
- `DB Search Sql` allows you to enter only the search criteria in SQL, it remains simpler than doing the SQL query entirely by hand. This statement introduces a little more SQL, and lowers the readability of the code.
- `DB Sql`  is pure SQL, it allows you to do more than the other 2, we are full-SQL here, so itâ€™s even less easy to write and possibly to read.
