DB Delete Record

// Purge database and create test data:
DB Delete Database "my_address_book"
DB Database "my_address_book"
DB Table "addresses"
DB New : Name$="One" : City$="Booh City" : DB Write "City$,Name$"
DB New : Name$="Two" : City$="Test City" : DB Write "City$,Name$"
DB New : Name$="Tre" : City$="Test City" : DB Write "City$,Name$"

// Select and search all addresses associated to a test city, then delete all found results:
DB Database "my_address_book"
DB Table "addresses"
DB Search "City$=Test City"
